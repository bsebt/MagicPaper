# MagicPaper
DeltaHacks

As a team we first met on the bus to DeltaHacks and thereafter magical things happened when we combined our forces to build the future.

Introducing Magic Paper!

The first wireless capacitative touchscreen. 

How does it work?

Simple. You hover your hand over the capacitors we created in any combination you like and its recorded. Do the same hand gesture as before and it will be recognized.

Built using RPi, and node.
